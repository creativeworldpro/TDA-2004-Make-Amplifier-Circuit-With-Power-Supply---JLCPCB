In this project, we’ll teach you making a simple mono amplifier circuit. It is a very cheap and powerful amplifier circuit. The most interesting part of this amplifier circuit is that, using only DC-12v power supply you can operate this amplifier circuit. For this case, you can use this amplifier circuit at your home, office, inside a bus, car, track and other places also.


Component List - 

Since it is a simple and powerful amplifier circuit, for that to make this amplifier circuit we might some electronics component.
We also need a DC (12-24) volt power supply circuit. We also teach you making a powerful power supply circuit.
Those component list have to been given below.

11. PCB (made by JLCPCB)


Amplifier Circuit Connection - 
To make this 20 watt amplifier circuit 1st we connect 460 Ω resistor with 4no leg of sound IC.
Then we connect a copper cable with 6no leg of sound IC. Continuously connect 2.2 Ω resistor with 8no and 10no leg of sound IC. 
Please remember that, all component other terminal will be empty.


Connect Capacitor with Amplifier Circuit - 

Now we connect 10µf/25v capacitor with the amplifier circuit. 
We connect this capacitor negative leg with 2no leg of sound IC and connect it’s positive leg with other terminal of 460 Ω resistor.
Then we connect Ceramic Disc Capacitor (103) with 2no and 6no leg of sound IC.

Connect Polyester Film Capacitor with Amplifier Circuit - 

We are using 5 pieces mylar polyester Film Capacitor with the amplifier circuit. Now we connect 2 pieces mylar polyester Film Capacitor with 5no and 7no leg of TDA 2004 sound IC.
Then we connect this capacitor empty terminal with each other then connect both terminal with 6no leg of sound IC.

After this connection, we connect 3no mylar polyester Film Capacitor with 1no leg of sound IC.


Connect Resistor with Amplifier Circuit - 

Now we need to connect 1.5 Ω and 150 Ω resistor with amplifier circuit. We connect these resistor both terminal with each other then connect the both resistor with mylar polyester Film Capacitor. Again we connect 100 Ω resistor with empty leg of 1.5 KΩ resistor. 
Then connect 100 Ω resistor other terminal with 150 Ω resistor.
Then we connect all empty terminal with 100 Ω resistor.

Connect Audio Input Cable - 

For output sound, we need to input sound to the amplifier circuit. We connect this audio input cable with amplifier circuit. We connect, audio input ground cable with 100 Ω resistor and connect audio input L/R cable with negative leg of capacitor.


Connect Sound Speaker - 
For output sound, now we need to connect a sound system/ sound speaker with the amplifier circuit. 
So we connect sound speaker cable with 8no and 10no leg of sound IC.


Now we need to make a power supply circuit to operate this amplifier circuit. We can operate this amplifier circuit using only DC (12-24) volt. 
Let’s make a power supply circuit.


12v Power Supply Design - 
The schematic of 12v power supply circuit design along with the PCB layout can be seen above.
Here Led light used to measure the voltage or used to check the accurate voltage of this circuit. To check this circuit, you also can use DC meter.


Bridge Connection of Power Supply - 

To make this circuit, 1st we need to make a bridge connection. We know that, there are two polarity terminal of a diode. 
To make this bridge connection, we connect two diode negative terminal and connect due two diode positive terminal with the circuit. 
Then we connect , two set diode positive leg with another diode negative leg and connect other terminal with the circuit.
It’s a complete bridge connection.


Filter Output Voltage - 

To filter voltage, we need to use a capacitor with the circuit. We are using 2200µf/ 25v capacitor with this circuit.
We connect capacitor negative leg with diode negative leg and connect capacitor positive leg with diode positive leg.


Connect Indicator System with circuit - 

For indicator, now we connect resistor and LED with the circuit. We are using 1k resistor to make this circuit. 
We connect resistor with capacitor positive leg and connect LED positive leg with resistor. 
Then connect LED negative leg with positive & negative leg of diode.


Connect Transformer with Power Supply - 

For power source we are using 12v transformer. If we want to make 15v power supply, for that we need to connect 15v transformer.
Now we connect transformer secondary section with the circuit. We connect secondary section cable with diode positive and negative leg.
We’ll get output voltage from capacitor positive and negative leg.
Positive voltage from capacitor positive leg and negative voltage from capacitor negative leg.


Soldering and Cleaning - 

Neat and perfect soldering play an important role for all kind of PCBs. Since soldering, you should remember that, there should not be any kind of short circuit connection.
After soldering all leg, we cut-off the extra leg of all electronics component. For better result you can use liquid PCB cleaner.


Thanks to JLCPCB, for sponsor us such a quality PCB board.


Connect Power Supply with Amplifier - 

We got two type voltage from the power supply circuit. 
We connect positive voltage with 7no, 9no and 11no leg of sound IC and then connect negative voltage with ground leg of this sound IC.
Our circuit is now completely ready for use. Just plug-in power and audio input system, then play music and enjoy the sound.
